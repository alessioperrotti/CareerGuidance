                    <p>Sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations are gaining prominence, influencing investment strategies and corporate policies. 
                        Finance professionals are increasingly required to integrate sustainability metrics into decision-making processes, fostering long-term value for both organizations and society.</p>
